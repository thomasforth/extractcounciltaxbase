# extractcounciltaxbase
Extract and combine data for many council tax base spreadsheets

## What it does
This code takes the UK government's raw housing data contained in [Council Taxbase](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/council-taxbase-2019-in-england) local authority level data spreadsheets, extracts it from variably formatted Excel spreadsheets, and outputs a single flat CSV file, containing the number of second homes in every English local authority. The output is yearly since 2010.

## Licence
MIT license for the code. Do whatever you like with this code.
No explicit licence is attached to the Council Taxbase data and thus [The Open Government Licence v3.0](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) applies to the raw data, and to the derivative output that I have produced.
